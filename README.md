<h2> What is my Project?</h2>

<p2>My project changed during the beginning of my project as it originally was based on making a 2.5D Music Library through the use of width and height to make the images seem as if they were farther away though in reality, they were the same distance away from the screen. My new project was to build a painting program which would have different brush strokes, sizes and colors whilst also having a music player built in as well.</p2>

<h2> Why did I choose this? </h2>
<p2> I choose to make my painting project because that was something I've always to try and do in processing but I chose to go in the direction of music though now I've decided that as of now I want to divert my attention towards trying new things in paint programs like a music player and different brush strokes which I haven't done before.
